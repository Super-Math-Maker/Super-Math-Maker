            Super Math Maker is an educational platformer game targeted towards late elementary to early middle school 
            students with a desire to learn math while still doing something they enjoy, gaming. This game works by quizzing 
            the students on various math concepts which rewards them with points they can spend to add objects to their platforming 
            level. This makes the game replayable and open to creative out of the box solutions to each level. The math quizzes can 
            also be targeted to certain topics like long division or simplifying fractions. This game seeks to provide a fun and 
            interesting way to practice math. The motivation for this game was that we wanted to create something that allowed students
             to reinforce their mathematical skills in a way thatâ€™s more engaging than a traditional homework assignment. We were inspired
              by various two dimensional platforms such as Mario and tried to blend that with aspects of games we have played on 
              coolmathgames.com because of how entertaining it made education when we were younger.
