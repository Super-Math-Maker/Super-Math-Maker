            Filler text I have no idea what the difference between the project background and the project description is supposed to be
            I'm sure I will figure it out eventually.

            Super Math Maker is an educational platformer game targeted towards late elementary, early middle school students with a desire
            to learn math while still doing something they enjoy, gaming.  This game works by quizzing the students on various math concepts
            which rewards them with points they can spend to add objects to their platforming level.  This makes the game replayable and open
            to creative out of the box solutions to each level.  The math quizzes can also be targeted to certain topics like long division or 
            simplifying fractions.  This game seeks to provide a fun and interesting way to practice math.
